Real-time data analysis using Google Kubernetes Engine, PubSub, and BigQuery

This repository contains [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
(GKE) apps that show how to build a 'pipeline' to stream data into BigQuery.


The app in the `pubsub` directory uses [Google Cloud PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs).
